at one point in time, a CMS- now a CMS again. sort of. 

txt-file based and lightweight, I coded the base of this a very long time ago. it was time for an update! the new version has cleaner code and a tumblr-inspired look. new features include two (2) ways of editing content- clean WYSIWYG with Summernote and raw syntax highlighted code with Codemirror, drag-and-drop image uploading,  and more modular settings.
